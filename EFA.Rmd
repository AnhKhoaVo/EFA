We have found that Albumin at week 4 is predictive of outcome - motor scores by week 52. However, I was wondering if a set of observed variables would have a better chance of predicting outcome than just one single variable. 

Exploratory Factor Analysis has been used to explore the possible underlying factor structure of a set of observed variables without imposing a preconcieved structure on the outcome. By performing EFA, the underlying factor structure is identified. 

```{FA.R}
cfa1_week0 <- scale(cfa_week0, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
cfa1_week0 <- as.data.frame(cfa1_week0)

cfa_week0$DAN00 <- NULL
cfa_week0$AMY00 <- NULL

library("psych")

efa <-  function(x) {
  scree <- fa.parallel(x[-1,-2], fm = "ml", fa = "fa")
  fa <- fa.diagram(fa(x[-1, -2], nfactors=6, rotate="oblimin", fm="ml"))
  return(list(scree, fa))
}
efa(cfa1_week0)
```
